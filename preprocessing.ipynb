How can a book that tries to tie together the bombing of Nagasaki, the partition of India, the Afghan conflict and 9/11 possibly work? Well, it does - I absolutely loved it. Hiroko is a wonderful character - she lives on the page in a way a character hasn't for me in ages, and she's the anchor that holds this enormous story together. The writing is quite beautiful - some of the imagery will really stay with me, but it really doesn't spoil the narative, quite the opposite. The moments of tenderness - her time with Konrad, the beginning of her relationship with her husband, after some of the deaths (there's a few - they make you ache with grief...) - are quite superb. The narrative thrust is sustained and ambitious - it's a blooming good story, well told. Learnt a fair bit about the politics (India/Pakistan/Afghanistan) that I didn't know before too, but in the nicest way - by slow immersion in a wonderful story. A definite 10/10 for me... \",\n          \"I was impressed with the scope of this novel - from Japan to Pakistan to America, and covering about half a century - it touched upon a broad spectrum of cultures, politics and lives, with the twists and turns in the story largely governed by geographic location. For me it was all about identity, and how a sense of identity can be damaged by the horror of an atomic bomb, or by failing exams, by subterfuge, or by looking different to those around you. But as well as exploring alienation, this book explores the wonderful ties that bind people together. The loves, the loyalties and the unavoidable ambivalence that makes up the knots that keep us together.Several people in this book have the world opened up to them via their extraordinary gifts with languages, and reading this as a monoglot I was extremely envious. This is my fantasy, an effortless learning whereby new languages simply fall into your lap, and you are able to take off to new lands or explore new cultures, with a vast chunk of you being already at home in these new places. Friends teaching friends, mother teaching son, seemingly almost by osmosis. Yeah, I was envious.I also liked the fact that I learnt a lot from this book. We didn\\u2019t spend enough time in any one culture to be utterly immersed in it, but we touched upon some fascinating experiences \\u2013 what it was like to be a German in Japan during the second world war, what it was like to be an educated Indian servant to a British family, what it was like to be in Pakistan and Afghanistan - supporting the mujahidean, what it was like to be on the run (both in Afghanistan and America), and what it was like to be a Muslim in New York after 9/11. It was most rewarding to have these experiences opened up to me.My one criticism is that some of the relationships felt a bit forced, almost too good to be true, also sometimes people\\u2019s lives seemed to take an unnecessary negative twist....almost on a whim. I felt like jogging the author\\u2019s elbow a couple of times. Having said that, most of the people in this book were beautifully evoked, their characters drawn with exquisite sensitivity, often via dialogue. All in all I found this book both moving and gripping. An excellent read.\",\n          \"I read so much, and so quickly, that it takes a rare exception of a book to send me searching for post-it notes and a pen to write down quotes from the writing. I found the writing in this book so compelling, that I stopped reading everything else for two whole days and just immersed myself in the story of a woman who finds herself in the midst of several acts of war in the lifetime. From Nagasaki where she is scared mentally and physically, to Delhi where she runs with her new husband from the violence that surrounds the retreat of England, to the rise of the Taliban in Pakistan where she almost looses her son, to her retirement in New York city in 2001, where she lives with a dear old friend. There is so much that happens in this book, I really can't even begin to summarize the plot further than that.\\\"Two years after the war, they could accept an ally of Hitler sooner than they could accept someone of a different class.\\\"Although all those circumstances may seem contrived to put together in one book, this book was so believable, that we kept catching ourselves at my bookclub talking about the characters as if they were people we knew. But in some ways they are. We are all expats living in Asia, most of us have lived in several countries, and most of us had had cross-cultural relationships. Although we haven't directly lived in the path of war, this book is us.\\\"We were just young and foolish, what did we know about each other? Almost nothing. It was luck, pure luck, that we discovered after marriage that our natures were so sympathetic to each other.\\\"I don't know if a truer statement has been written about the vibe of an Asian city, \\\"...world's urban tribes as they enter unfamiliar landscapes of chaos and possibility.. cars using their horns in a complicated and unrelenting exchange about power, intention, and mis-trust.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It is an epic tale sweeping across continents over a sixty-year period. Burnt Shadows by Kamila Shamsie begins in Nagasaki on August 9, 1945; goes to India just before partition in 1947; to Pakistan in 1982-1983; and concludes in New York and Afghanistan in 2001-2002. The central figure is Hiroko Tanaka, a Nagasaki resident. The novel opens with her as a twenty-one-year-old and engaged to a man of English and German descent. When the atomic bomb is dropped on Nagasaki, Hiroko loses her fianc\\u00e9 and her father. In addition to her emotional and psychological scars, Hiroko carries disfiguring burn scars on her back. Having lost everything in Nagasaki, she decides to make a clean break. She visits her fianc\\u00e9\\u2019s half-sister, Elizabeth Weiss, who lives in India with her husband, James Burton. There she meets and marries Sajjad Ashraf, a Muslim employed by the Burtons. The partition in India forces the newly-weds to relocate temporarily to Istanbul then to Pakistan which they call home for nearly twenty years until Sajjad\\u2019s untimely death. Hiroko then relocates to New York to live with Elizabeth. The ties connecting the Tanakas, the Ashrafs, and the Burtons extend to their respective children, Henry Burton and Raza Ashraf, and to Henry\\u2019s daughter, Kim Burton.Shamsie skillfully infuses the different time frames and locations with historical and political events. Through Hiroko\\u2019s eyes, we see Nagasaki in the aftermath of the atomic bomb. We see the escalating tensions in India between British colonists, Hindus, and Muslims. From neighboring Pakistan, we see Afghanistan\\u2019s armed struggle against Russian occupation. And in New York, we see the aftermath of 9/11. Set against the backdrop of global conflicts over a period of nearly sixty years, this family saga wrestles with a number of complex issues. Scenes throughout reveal cross-cultural conflicts, racism, cultural understanding, cultural arrogance, ethnocentrism, loyalty, sacrifice, family, othering, betrayal, and the displacement of a civilian population. The four sections are seamlessly woven together with transitional passages to explain the leaps in time and location. The characters are unique, believable, and speak in authentic voices. Shamsie\\u2019s portrayal of Hiroko is particularly effective. She emerges as independent, loving, strong, tender, adaptable, and the anchor which binds the narrative and families together. Her fluency in several languages illustrates how language facilitates understanding and appreciation of a culture. But fluency in languages and dialects can also have catastrophic consequences, as evidenced by Raza. Having inherited his mother\\u2019s language skills, Raza sets in motion a series of events which end tragically. Hiroko\\u2019s character also contrasts racism with acceptance of the other. When Kim Burton seeks understanding for reporting an Afghan Muslim to authorities solely on the basis of a shared religion with the 9/11 terrorists, Hiroko responds with, \\u201cShould I look at you and see Harry Truman?\\u201d Enough said.A very powerful and compelling novel showing the impact of global conflicts on the lives of individuals. Told with compassion and sensitivity in immersive, riveting language.Very highly recommended.My book reviews are also available at www.tamaraaghajaffar.com\",\n          \"For me,it is Kamila Shamsie's second best book,after Home Fire.Not that I'd call it a great book,but it's still much better than the rest of her books.It tries to tackle too many subjects,and doesn't quite succeed.It begins with the story of a Japanese victim of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki.But if the idea was to show the destructive effects of the atomic bomb on this victim,that doesn't happen.The Japanese woman moves to India and goes through the rest of her life, without showing any ill effects.The book then goes on to include a pet peeve of Kamila Shamsie, the partition of India and the creation of Pakistan.It is a constant theme in her work as her own family had to move to Pakistan at the time of partition.Then,there are detailed descriptions of life in Karachi.It helps to fill up the pages and is also part of several of her other books.After that,she returns to international conflict once again.First comes the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan,and a Karachi young man's journey to fight the Soviets.This whole section is very superficial.Added for good measure is the story of a US agent and his daughter as well.Then comes the US invasion of Afghanistan,and that is included,as well.Again,nothing special about this part of the book.In between,the subcontinent becomes nuclearised in 1998 after India's nuclear tests and Pakistan following suit.So,the Japanese woman,already a victim of the nuclear bomb, gets scared and moves to New York.While some parts of the book were interesting,at times it felt very contrived,particularly the portion on Afghanistan.The last hundred pages,in particular were so boring that I was relieved when it finally came to an end.A good many of the situations in the book,are scarcely believeable.Too many conflicts are included,without focusing effectively on any one of them.The book essentially lacks a coherent storyline.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It is an epic tale sweeping across continents over a sixty-year period. Burnt Shadows by Kamila Shamsie begins in Nagasaki on August 9, 1945; goes to India just before partition in 1947; to Pakistan in 1982-1983; and concludes in New York and Afghanistan in 2001-2002. The central figure is Hiroko Tanaka, a Nagasaki resident. The novel opens with her as a twenty-one-year-old and engaged to a man of English and German descent. When the atomic bomb is dropped on Nagasaki, Hiroko loses her fianc\\u00e9 and her father. In addition to her emotional and psychological scars, Hiroko carries disfiguring burn scars on her back. Having lost everything in Nagasaki, she decides to make a clean break. She visits her fianc\\u00e9\\u2019s half-sister, Elizabeth Weiss, who lives in India with her husband, James Burton. There she meets and marries Sajjad Ashraf, a Muslim employed by the Burtons. The partition in India forces the newly-weds to relocate temporarily to Istanbul then to Pakistan which they call home for nearly twenty years until Sajjad\\u2019s untimely death. Hiroko then relocates to New York to live with Elizabeth. The ties connecting the Tanakas, the Ashrafs, and the Burtons extend to their respective children, Henry Burton and Raza Ashraf, and to Henry\\u2019s daughter, Kim Burton.Shamsie skillfully infuses the different time frames and locations with historical and political events. Through Hiroko\\u2019s eyes, we see Nagasaki in the aftermath of the atomic bomb. We see the escalating tensions in India between British colonists, Hindus, and Muslims. From neighboring Pakistan, we see Afghanistan\\u2019s armed struggle against Russian occupation. And in New York, we see the aftermath of 9/11. Set against the backdrop of global conflicts over a period of nearly sixty years, this family saga wrestles with a number of complex issues. Scenes throughout reveal cross-cultural conflicts, racism, cultural understanding, cultural arrogance, ethnocentrism, loyalty, sacrifice, family, othering, betrayal, and the displacement of a civilian population. The four sections are seamlessly woven together with transitional passages to explain the leaps in time and location. The characters are unique, believable, and speak in authentic voices. Shamsie\\u2019s portrayal of Hiroko is particularly effective. She emerges as independent, loving, strong, tender, adaptable, and the anchor which binds the narrative and families together. Her fluency in several languages illustrates how language facilitates understanding and appreciation of a culture. But fluency in languages and dialects can also have catastrophic consequences, as evidenced by Raza. Having inherited his mother\\u2019s language skills, Raza sets in motion a series of events which end tragically. Hiroko\\u2019s character also contrasts racism with acceptance of the other. When Kim Burton seeks understanding for reporting an Afghan Muslim to authorities solely on the basis of a shared religion with the 9/11 terrorists, Hiroko responds with, \\u201cShould I look at you and see Harry Truman?\\u201d Enough said.A very powerful and compelling novel showing the impact of global conflicts on the lives of individuals. Told with compassion and sensitivity in immersive, riveting language.Very highly recommended.My book reviews are also available at www.tamaraaghajaffar.com\",\n          \"For me,it is Kamila Shamsie's second best book,after Home Fire.Not that I'd call it a great book,but it's still much better than the rest of her books.It tries to tackle too many subjects,and doesn't quite succeed.It begins with the story of a Japanese victim of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki.But if the idea was to show the destructive effects of the atomic bomb on this victim,that doesn't happen.The Japanese woman moves to India and goes through the rest of her life, without showing any ill effects.The book then goes on to include a pet peeve of Kamila Shamsie, the partition of India and the creation of Pakistan.It is a constant theme in her work as her own family had to move to Pakistan at the time of partition.Then,there are detailed descriptions of life in Karachi.It helps to fill up the pages and is also part of several of her other books.After that,she returns to international conflict once again.First comes the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan,and a Karachi young man's journey to fight the Soviets.This whole section is very superficial.Added for good measure is the story of a US agent and his daughter as well.Then comes the US invasion of Afghanistan,and that is included,as well.Again,nothing special about this part of the book.In between,the subcontinent becomes nuclearised in 1998 after India's nuclear tests and Pakistan following suit.So,the Japanese woman,already a victim of the nuclear bomb, gets scared and moves to New York.While some parts of the book were interesting,at times it felt very contrived,particularly the portion on Afghanistan.The last hundred pages,in particular were so boring that I was relieved when it finally came to an end.A good many of the situations in the book,are scarcely believeable.Too many conflicts are included,without focusing effectively on any one of them.The book essentially lacks a coherent storyline.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It is an epic tale sweeping across continents over a sixty-year period. Burnt Shadows by Kamila Shamsie begins in Nagasaki on August 9, 1945; goes to India just before partition in 1947; to Pakistan in 1982-1983; and concludes in New York and Afghanistan in 2001-2002. The central figure is Hiroko Tanaka, a Nagasaki resident. The novel opens with her as a twenty-one-year-old and engaged to a man of English and German descent. When the atomic bomb is dropped on Nagasaki, Hiroko loses her fianc\\u00e9 and her father. In addition to her emotional and psychological scars, Hiroko carries disfiguring burn scars on her back. Having lost everything in Nagasaki, she decides to make a clean break. She visits her fianc\\u00e9\\u2019s half-sister, Elizabeth Weiss, who lives in India with her husband, James Burton. There she meets and marries Sajjad Ashraf, a Muslim employed by the Burtons. The partition in India forces the newly-weds to relocate temporarily to Istanbul then to Pakistan which they call home for nearly twenty years until Sajjad\\u2019s untimely death. Hiroko then relocates to New York to live with Elizabeth. The ties connecting the Tanakas, the Ashrafs, and the Burtons extend to their respective children, Henry Burton and Raza Ashraf, and to Henry\\u2019s daughter, Kim Burton.Shamsie skillfully infuses the different time frames and locations with historical and political events. Through Hiroko\\u2019s eyes, we see Nagasaki in the aftermath of the atomic bomb. We see the escalating tensions in India between British colonists, Hindus, and Muslims. From neighboring Pakistan, we see Afghanistan\\u2019s armed struggle against Russian occupation. And in New York, we see the aftermath of 9/11. Set against the backdrop of global conflicts over a period of nearly sixty years, this family saga wrestles with a number of complex issues. Scenes throughout reveal cross-cultural conflicts, racism, cultural understanding, cultural arrogance, ethnocentrism, loyalty, sacrifice, family, othering, betrayal, and the displacement of a civilian population. The four sections are seamlessly woven together with transitional passages to explain the leaps in time and location. The characters are unique, believable, and speak in authentic voices. Shamsie\\u2019s portrayal of Hiroko is particularly effective. She emerges as independent, loving, strong, tender, adaptable, and the anchor which binds the narrative and families together. Her fluency in several languages illustrates how language facilitates understanding and appreciation of a culture. But fluency in languages and dialects can also have catastrophic consequences, as evidenced by Raza. Having inherited his mother\\u2019s language skills, Raza sets in motion a series of events which end tragically. Hiroko\\u2019s character also contrasts racism with acceptance of the other. When Kim Burton seeks understanding for reporting an Afghan Muslim to authorities solely on the basis of a shared religion with the 9/11 terrorists, Hiroko responds with, \\u201cShould I look at you and see Harry Truman?\\u201d Enough said.A very powerful and compelling novel showing the impact of global conflicts on the lives of individuals. Told with compassion and sensitivity in immersive, riveting language.Very highly recommended.My book reviews are also available at www.tamaraaghajaffar.com\",\n          \"For me,it is Kamila Shamsie's second best book,after Home Fire.Not that I'd call it a great book,but it's still much better than the rest of her books.It tries to tackle too many subjects,and doesn't quite succeed.It begins with the story of a Japanese victim of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki.But if the idea was to show the destructive effects of the atomic bomb on this victim,that doesn't happen.The Japanese woman moves to India and goes through the rest of her life, without showing any ill effects.The book then goes on to include a pet peeve of Kamila Shamsie, the partition of India and the creation of Pakistan.It is a constant theme in her work as her own family had to move to Pakistan at the time of partition.Then,there are detailed descriptions of life in Karachi.It helps to fill up the pages and is also part of several of her other books.After that,she returns to international conflict once again.First comes the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan,and a Karachi young man's journey to fight the Soviets.This whole section is very superficial.Added for good measure is the story of a US agent and his daughter as well.Then comes the US invasion of Afghanistan,and that is included,as well.Again,nothing special about this part of the book.In between,the subcontinent becomes nuclearised in 1998 after India's nuclear tests and Pakistan following suit.So,the Japanese woman,already a victim of the nuclear bomb, gets scared and moves to New York.While some parts of the book were interesting,at times it felt very contrived,particularly the portion on Afghanistan.The last hundred pages,in particular were so boring that I was relieved when it finally came to an end.A good many of the situations in the book,are scarcely believeable.Too many conflicts are included,without focusing effectively on any one of them.The book essentially lacks a coherent storyline.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"description_lengths\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 373,\n        \"min\": 24,\n        \"max\": 1340,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 13,\n        \"samples\": [\n          91,\n          533,\n          348\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It is an epic tale sweeping across continents over a sixty-year period. Burnt Shadows by Kamila Shamsie begins in Nagasaki on August 9, 1945; goes to India just before partition in 1947; to Pakistan in 1982-1983; and concludes in New York and Afghanistan in 2001-2002. The central figure is Hiroko Tanaka, a Nagasaki resident. The novel opens with her as a twenty-one-year-old and engaged to a man of English and German descent. When the atomic bomb is dropped on Nagasaki, Hiroko loses her fianc\\u00e9 and her father. In addition to her emotional and psychological scars, Hiroko carries disfiguring burn scars on her back. Having lost everything in Nagasaki, she decides to make a clean break. She visits her fianc\\u00e9\\u2019s half-sister, Elizabeth Weiss, who lives in India with her husband, James Burton. There she meets and marries Sajjad Ashraf, a Muslim employed by the Burtons. The partition in India forces the newly-weds to relocate temporarily to Istanbul then to Pakistan which they call home for nearly twenty years until Sajjad\\u2019s untimely death. Hiroko then relocates to New York to live with Elizabeth. The ties connecting the Tanakas, the Ashrafs, and the Burtons extend to their respective children, Henry Burton and Raza Ashraf, and to Henry\\u2019s daughter, Kim Burton.Shamsie skillfully infuses the different time frames and locations with historical and political events. Through Hiroko\\u2019s eyes, we see Nagasaki in the aftermath of the atomic bomb. We see the escalating tensions in India between British colonists, Hindus, and Muslims. From neighboring Pakistan, we see Afghanistan\\u2019s armed struggle against Russian occupation. And in New York, we see the aftermath of 9/11. Set against the backdrop of global conflicts over a period of nearly sixty years, this family saga wrestles with a number of complex issues. Scenes throughout reveal cross-cultural conflicts, racism, cultural understanding, cultural arrogance, ethnocentrism, loyalty, sacrifice, family, othering, betrayal, and the displacement of a civilian population. The four sections are seamlessly woven together with transitional passages to explain the leaps in time and location. The characters are unique, believable, and speak in authentic voices. Shamsie\\u2019s portrayal of Hiroko is particularly effective. She emerges as independent, loving, strong, tender, adaptable, and the anchor which binds the narrative and families together. Her fluency in several languages illustrates how language facilitates understanding and appreciation of a culture. But fluency in languages and dialects can also have catastrophic consequences, as evidenced by Raza. Having inherited his mother\\u2019s language skills, Raza sets in motion a series of events which end tragically. Hiroko\\u2019s character also contrasts racism with acceptance of the other. When Kim Burton seeks understanding for reporting an Afghan Muslim to authorities solely on the basis of a shared religion with the 9/11 terrorists, Hiroko responds with, \\u201cShould I look at you and see Harry Truman?\\u201d Enough said.A very powerful and compelling novel showing the impact of global conflicts on the lives of individuals. Told with compassion and sensitivity in immersive, riveting language.Very highly recommended.My book reviews are also available at www.tamaraaghajaffar.com\",\n          \"For me,it is Kamila Shamsie's second best book,after Home Fire.Not that I'd call it a great book,but it's still much better than the rest of her books.It tries to tackle too many subjects,and doesn't quite succeed.It begins with the story of a Japanese victim of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki.But if the idea was to show the destructive effects of the atomic bomb on this victim,that doesn't happen.The Japanese woman moves to India and goes through the rest of her life, without showing any ill effects.The book then goes on to include a pet peeve of Kamila Shamsie, the partition of India and the creation of Pakistan.It is a constant theme in her work as her own family had to move to Pakistan at the time of partition.Then,there are detailed descriptions of life in Karachi.It helps to fill up the pages and is also part of several of her other books.After that,she returns to international conflict once again.First comes the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan,and a Karachi young man's journey to fight the Soviets.This whole section is very superficial.Added for good measure is the story of a US agent and his daughter as well.Then comes the US invasion of Afghanistan,and that is included,as well.Again,nothing special about this part of the book.In between,the subcontinent becomes nuclearised in 1998 after India's nuclear tests and Pakistan following suit.So,the Japanese woman,already a victim of the nuclear bomb, gets scared and moves to New York.While some parts of the book were interesting,at times it felt very contrived,particularly the portion on Afghanistan.The last hundred pages,in particular were so boring that I was relieved when it finally came to an end.A good many of the situations in the book,are scarcely believeable.Too many conflicts are included,without focusing effectively on any one of them.The book essentially lacks a coherent storyline.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"description_lengths\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 373,\n        \"min\": 24,\n        \"max\": 1340,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 13,\n        \"samples\": [\n          91,\n          533,\n          348\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
